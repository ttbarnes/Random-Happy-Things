Random-Happy-Things
===================

This *was* a work in progress. Feel free to adapt/contribute.

The idea was to create html/css only DOM elements that are visually 'happy'.

The Sass isn't the cleanest, - just for doing quick POCs.

To get up and running:

1. `npm install && bower install`
2. `grunt serve`

Happy random things! :-)
