Random-Happy-Things
===================

Readme to be updated....

Some of the code isn't the cleanest (mainly the Sass), just for doing quick POCs.

Any contributions would be great, i'm hoping to wrap this up at some point in 2015.

To get up and running:

1. cd into directory
2. npm install
3. bower install
4. grunt serve

Happy random things! :-)
