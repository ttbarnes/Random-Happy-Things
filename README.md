Random-Happy-Things
===================

This *was* a work in progress. Feel free to adapt/contribute.

The idea was to create html/css only DOM elements that are visually 'happy', and change the appearance dynamically by utilising angular two way data binding.

The code isn't the cleanest, these are some quick POCs.

To get up and running:

1. `npm install && bower install`
2. `grunt serve`

Happy random things! :-)
